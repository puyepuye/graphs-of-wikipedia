## Ongoing - Updates
Claire - Getting Wikipedia pages, titles, and links probably can't get any better than this. Right now I just have to run create_graph overnight many times to destroy my cpu and add more stuff to the graph, but it's 21.9 MB right now so I actually don't know if I should. I only ran it twice on wiki/Tree and wiki/University_Of_Toronto lol ;-;

### create_graph.py
This function recursively explores links on a webpage up to a specified level. It starts from a given `start_url` and collects links from the page. For each link, it adds the link's title to a dictionary `data` with the title of the `start_url` as the key. If the current level is less than the specified `level`, the function recursively calls itself for each link found, incrementing the current level. Once it reaches the specified `level`, it saves the `visited` set and the `data` dictionary to files (`visited_file` and `graph_file`, respectively).

### bfs.py
This code defines a breadth-first search (BFS) function BFS_path that finds a path between two nodes (s1 and s2) in a graph (G). It uses a queue (Q) to traverse the graph starting from the s1 node. The function also handles loading a graph from a file using the load_dict_from_file function. 

## TODO
- graph making more efficiently (claire)
- return multiple paths (claire)
- interactive ui (puye)
- expand the graph (claire)
- clean up pyTA
- The latex stuff
- Improve readability (Mac)
- Automcomplete for when you input something (Mac)
